Using the terminal, change directory using the command cd fullstack/vagrant, then type vagrant up to launch your virtual machine.

Once it is up and running, type vagrant ssh. This will log your terminal into the virtual machine, and you'll get a Linux shell prompt. When you want to log out, type exit at the shell prompt. To turn the virtual machine off (without deleting anything), type vagrant halt. If you do this, you'll need to run vagrant up again before you can log into it.

Now that you have Vagrant up and running type vagrant ssh to log into your virtual machine (VM). Change directory to the /vagrant directory by typing cd /vagrant. This will take you to the shared folder between your virtual machine and host machine.
